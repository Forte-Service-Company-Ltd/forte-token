# Documentation maintenance

This repository has two types of documentation:
1. Manually generated - this is the documentation that is written by hand
2. Auto-generated - this is the documentation that is generated by the code

## Manually Generated Documentation
The manually generated documentation root can be found [here][userGuide-url].

## Auto-generated Documentation
This repository utilized Foundary documentation generation for files using NatSpec comments. The commands to generate this documentation and to keep them up to date are:
(Note: This is currently performed by CI/CD processes and not manually run.)
The root of the documentation can be found [here](./src/SUMMARY.md).
