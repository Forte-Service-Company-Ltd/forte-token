# Token 
- [Token](./UserGuides/token/token.md) is an ERC20 Upgradeable token and allows for the logic contract to be updated overtime. The token will utilize existing rules protocol architecure: the asset handler, application manager and handler, and the rule processor diamond. The token uses Access Control Upgradeable for the admin roles that guard certain functions within the token.
